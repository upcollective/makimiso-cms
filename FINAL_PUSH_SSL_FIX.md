```

## What You Need to Complete

### 1. Fix SSL Configuration (Priority 1)

# OR 
DATABASE_SSL=prefer  # More secure option
```

### 2. Restart and Verify (Priority 1)
- Restart container after SSL fix
- Confirm "Server started on port 1337" message
- Verify http://localhost:1337/admin is accessible

### 3. Setup Content Types (Priority 2)
Once admin is accessible:
- Create Blog Post content type
- Create Portfolio Item content type  
- Set public API permissions

### 4. Final Testing (Priority 2)
- Create test content
- Verify API endpoints work
- Test basic API integration

## Expected Final Result
- ✅ Strapi admin panel accessible
- ✅ Connected to Supabase PostgreSQL 
- ✅ Content types configured
- ✅ API endpoints returning data
- ✅ Ready for makimiso.com integration

## Success Criteria
User should be able to:
1. Access http://localhost:1337/admin
2. Create admin account
3. Add blog posts and portfolio items
4. See API data at /api/blog-posts
