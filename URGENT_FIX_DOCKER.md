# 🐛 Docker Image Issue - URGENT FIX NEEDED

## Problem
The `docker-compose.yml` file is using a non-existent Strapi Docker image version:
```
image: strapi/strapi:4.15.5
```

This fails with:
```
manifest for strapi/strapi:4.15.5 not found: manifest unknown
```

## What You Need to Fix

### 1. Update docker-compose.yml
- Use the correct Strapi Docker image (research the latest available version)
- Based on my research, either use:
  - `strapi/strapi` (latest tag)
  - `naskio/strapi` (community version for v4)
  - Build a custom image if needed

### 2. Test the Fix
- Ensure `docker-compose up -d` works
- Verify Strapi starts successfully
- Confirm admin panel is accessible at http://localhost:1337/admin

### 3. Update Documentation
- Update SETUP.md with any changes needed
- Ensure instructions are accurate

## Current Status
- ✅ Environment (.env) is configured with Supabase credentials
- ✅ All project structure is ready
- ❌ Docker image issue preventing startup

## Expected Result
User should be able to run:
```bash
cd "/Users/jarrettdavis/Documents/Work Projects/Makimiso Projects/makimiso-cms"
docker-compose up -d
```

And successfully access Strapi admin at http://localhost:1337/admin

## Priority: HIGH
This is blocking the entire setup. Please fix the Docker configuration and get Strapi running.
